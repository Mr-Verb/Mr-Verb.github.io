Several criminals have exploited this breach and escaped into the 1,000 by 1,000 grid of city blocks. Their movements are erratic, and tracking them has become a daunting task for the authorities. Your mission is to analyze their unpredictable escape routes, pinpoint their final locations, and help the city regain control of its streets. Can you outsmart their luck and bring these criminals to justice before they vanish within the sprawling urban grid?
